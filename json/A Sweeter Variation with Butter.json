Then add the melted butter into the mix, sift the flour and baking powder onto the mix and blend vigorously to ensure uniformity. The batter will be sticky and stiff. As needed, adjust the mixture with a few tablespoons of water or flour to slightly thin or stiffen the batter so it flows ribbon-like off of a tablespoon."
