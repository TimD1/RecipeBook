            "text": "You can make and serve this classic French soup in many different ways. Leave the vegetables whole and cook them in water alone for the most rustic version, enriched only with a little butter at serving time. For an even richer, more elegant variation, puree the soup in a food mill, food processor or blender, then stir in about 1 cup light single cream and gently rewarm. Chill that creamy soup and you have a classic vichyssoise. The hot puree is also good with some shredded Swiss or cheddar cheese stirred in at the last minute."

            "text": "In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the leeks and saute just until they begin to soften, 3-5 minutes. Add the stock and potatoes, bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer until the potatoes are very tender, about 20 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle into warmed bowls and garnish with the chives."
