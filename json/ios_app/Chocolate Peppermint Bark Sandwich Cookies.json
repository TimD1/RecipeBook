Place a disc on a lightly floured work surface, sprinkle flour on top and use rolling pin to roll dough 1/4 inch thick. Use cookie cutters to cut into 1 1/2 inch circles or star shapes. Repeat with the second disc. After you roll out the second disc combine scraps from each and reroll."

(You can put a little flour on your hands if needed.) Wrap the parchment paper around the log and gently roll the parchment paper and log together to make the log round. Repeat with the other log and a second piece of parchment paper. Refrigerate logs until hard, about 1 hour. (You want it hard enough so when you slice it your cookies stay round and dont get squished on one side.) Slice the dough 1/4 inch thick. Place 2 inches apart on parchment lined baking sheets."

Once cookies have cooled, brush the undersides of each with the remaining melted chocolate. Place a peppermint square on top of half the cookies. Place a second cookie, melted chocolate side down on top making a sandwich. Let the chocolate harden, about 30 minutes."
