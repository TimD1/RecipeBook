Cut two 9'' circles of brown paper (grocery bags), place on the cookie sheets and cover each with half the meringue mixture. Bake at 275 for 1 hour then let cool in oven (overnight works well). Combine whipped cream and crushed toffee bars. Spread half between meringue layers and half on top. Let chil in fridge at least 8 hours. Hint: Freeze Heath bars and they will be easier to crush."
