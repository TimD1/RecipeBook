Roll from long end and slice into 20-24 pieces. (I usually make 20 pieces if I use a 9x13 pan, 24 in a 10x14 pan). Pour topping in the bottom of your baking pan and sprinkle with nuts if desired. Place cut pieces of dough on top and let rise 1 hour or until the sticky buns are well risen. *to bake in the morning, place the pan in the fridge before the last rising, let come to room temperature and rise before baking. Bake @ 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Enjoy!!"
